# Java Static Keyword Mini Projects

This repository contains four Core Java mini projects created to understand
and practice the static keyword. All projects focus on how static variables
and static methods work at the class level and how they are shared across
objects in real-world scenarios.

## Projects Included

### 1. BankAccount System
Description:
A simple banking application that demonstrates the use of static variables
to store common bank information shared by all accounts.

Static Keyword Usage:
- Static variable for common bank data
- Static method access using class name

Key Learning:
Static variables are created once and shared by all objects of a class.

---

### 2. Inventory Management System
Description:
A basic inventory system that tracks items in stock.
A static variable is used to maintain the total number of items
across all inventory objects.

Static Keyword Usage:
- Static variable to track total stock

Key Learning:
Static variables are ideal for maintaining shared data at the class level.

---

### 3. Stock Price Tracker
Description:
This project simulates stock price tracking.
It uses a static variable to count the total number of stocks being tracked,
while each stock maintains its own price.

Static Keyword Usage:
- Static variable for counting stock objects
- Static method to access total stock count

Key Learning:
Static members help track and manage class-wide information.

---

### 4. MathOperations (Static Method Example)
Description:
A simple Java program that demonstrates the use of static methods.
Mathematical operations are performed using a static method
called directly using the class name without creating an object.

Static Keyword Usage:
- Static method
- Class-level method invocation

Key Learning:
Static methods belong to the class and can be used without creating objects.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Core Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

---

## Purpose
These projects were created to strengthen understanding of the static keyword
and its practical usage in Core Java. The goal is to build a strong foundation
for Java interviews and real-world programming.
