# 🚀 Polymorphism in Java (Practice Projects)

This repository contains three Java projects created to understand and demonstrate the concept of Polymorphism in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

The projects cover:
- Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)
- Run-Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)

---

## 📌 Projects Included

### 1️⃣ Calculator – Method Overloading
Concept Used: Compile-Time Polymorphism

Description:
This project demonstrates method overloading by creating multiple add() methods with different numbers of parameters and different data types.

Key Learning:
- Same method name
- Different Parameter
- Within same class
- Method resolution at compile time

---

### 2️⃣ Library Management System – Method Overriding
Concept Used: Run-Time Polymorphism

Description:
A base class LibraryItem is extended by Book, EBook, and DVD classes.  
Each child class overrides the displayInfo() method to show specific details.

Key Learning:
- Method overriding
- Dynamic method dispatch

---

### 3️⃣ E-Commerce System – Overloading + Overriding
Concept Used: Compile-Time + Run-Time Polymorphism

Description:
A simple e-commerce system with a base class Product and child classes Electronics and Clothing.  
The calculateDiscount() method is overloaded in the base class and overridden in child classes.

Key Learning:
- Real-world polymorphism example
- Parent reference holding child object
- Runtime method selection

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Eclipse IDE

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- Polymorphism
- Method Overloading
- Method Overriding
- Compile-Time vs Run-Time Polymorphism

---
## ✅ Conclusion
These projects helped me build a  foundation in Java Polymorphism by applying concepts in real-world examples.
