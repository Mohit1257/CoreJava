# Bank Account Abstraction Project (Java)

## 📌 Project Description
This project demonstrates the concept of **Abstraction in Java** using a simple **Banking System** example.

An abstract class `BankAccount` acts as a blueprint, while Paraent  classes  
`SavingsAccount` and `CheckingAccount` provide their own implementations for withdrawal rules.

This project is designed for **Java freshers** to clearly understand how abstraction works in real-world scenarios.
